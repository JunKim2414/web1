<h2>Let's Swim</h2>
I started to learn how to swim
<p>when I was in my freshman year of college.
At first, I was quite scared to hold my breath in the water,
so I was thinking about giving up swimming. </p>
<p>But, I decided to overcome my fear of water.
Every morning I went to swimming pool and practiced swimming.
And now, Swimming has become <strong>my favorite activity!</strong>
I can enjoy swimming so freely.
In addition, now I have confident that I could overcome <u>any fear!</u>
