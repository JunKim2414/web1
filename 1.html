<h2>Just look around you!</h2>
<p>The reason why I study English is that
I really want to <strong>have conversations with
my foreign friends</strong> freely!

I have known some people from different countries.
We've met at a bible study meeting.
We have fun time every week.
I wish we could know more things about them.
